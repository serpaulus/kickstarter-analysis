# Kickstarter Play Funding Outcomes Based on Lunch date and Funding Goal


## Project Overview 

The purpose of this project is to find data insights in to how different funding campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals based on Kickstarter campaign data.

## Analysis

We looked at the [number of successful, failed and cancelled campaigns](https://github.com/serpaulus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Kickstarter_Challenge_Submission.zip), the percentages [outcomes based on goal]( https://github.com/serpaulus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) amounts amount, and the [outcomes based on launch date.]( https://github.com/serpaulus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) across the year. 
#### Challenges
The analysis of the data was very straight forward except for some peculiarities in the format the Kickstarter provides data such as dates, which contributes to slight delays in analysis.   

## Results

Taking a closer look at the [Theater Outcomes by Launch Date](https://github.com/serpaulus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) we see:

1) The number of successful campaigns is larger than the number of failed campaigns throughout most of the year, except the month of December

2) The rate of success for campaigns is higher in the months of April thru August
      
Looking at the [outcomes based on goals]( https://github.com/serpaulus/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) we see:

1) A very symmetrical pattern between the percentage of successful and failed campaigns. with the percentage of successful campaigns decreasing inversely proportional to the monetary goal value up to $25000, with rate of success variances of the higher ranges but with significant less numbers. The opposite shows true for failed campaigns. 

2) The number of both, successful and failed campaigns, decreased in proportion to the increase of the goal amount.   

## In Summary

This data indicates that the probability of success for a theater project funding campaign is higher during the spring and summer months and lower towards the ends of the year specially the month of December.  The numbers of successful is higher at the $1000-$4999 range, with fairly linear decrease at higher amounts.  
## Recommendations
This data also shows indicators that monetary goal amount is not always the decisive factor. Recommend further analysis of criteria such as subject of plays, target audience, and audience satisfaction reviews.
